    populate that file and call UpdateStatus on the Transfer object. The test
    driver is responsible for deleting the file once the test is complete.

    The filters parameter is a map of filters to be applied to the results
    device-side before transmitting them back to the adapter.

    used as a signal to call UpdateStatus on the newly created Transfer
    (potentially after a timeout).

    The path is of the new Transfer object, and the filters are as provided to
    PullAll. The transfer filename is the full path and filename of a newly
    created empty temporary file which the test driver should write to.

    The test driver should then call UpdateStatus on the Transfer object each
    time a write is made to the transfer file. The final call to UpdateStatus
    should mark the transfer as complete.

    The test driver is responsible for deleting the transfer file once the test
    is complete.

    FIXME: Ideally the UpdateStatus method would only be used for completion,
    and all intermediate updates would be found by watching the size of the
    transfer file. However, that means adding a dependency on an inotify
    package, which seems a little much.
