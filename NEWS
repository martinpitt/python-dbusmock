0.7.2 (2013-08-30)
------------------
 - Add optional "timeout" argument to DBusTestCase.wait_for_bus_object().
   (LP: #1218318)
 - DBusTestCase.start_system_bus(): Make the fake bus look more like a real
   system bus by specifying a configuration file with type "system".

0.7.1 (2013-08-02)
------------------
 - Handle the "Disconnected" signal only if it comes from the D-BUS object, to
   avoid accidentally reacting to other signals (like from BlueZ). Thanks
   Lucas De Marchi.

0.7 (2013-07-30)
----------------
 - Accept *.py files for the --template command line option, similar to
   AddTemplate(). Thanks Emanuele Aina.
 - Pass log file to objects created with AddObject(). Thanks Emanuele Aina.
 - NetworkManager template: Add new method AddWiFiConnection(), to simulate a
   connection associated to a previously added device (with AddWiFiDevice()).
   Thanks Pete Woods.

0.6.3 (2013-06-13)
------------------
 - Drop "can-suspend" and "can-hibernate" checks from upower template test.
   upower 1.0 deprecates this functionality, and defaults to not building it.

0.6.2 (2013-06-13)
------------------
 - Fix test_api.TestSubclass test to work without an existing session D-BUS.

0.6.1 (2013-06-13)
------------------
 - Add dbusmock.__version__ attribute, as per PEP-0396.
 - Fix not being able to inherit from DBusMockObject. Thanks Lucas De Marchi!
 - Allow subclassed DBusMockObject constructors to specify props arguments as
   None.
 - Fix failing notification-daemon tests for too old libnotify. (LP: #1190208)
 - notification_daemon template: Generate new IDs for Notify() calls with an
   input ID of 0. (LP: #1190209 part 1)
 - notification_daemon template: Send NotificationClosed signal in
   CloseNotification() method for valid IDs. (LP: #1190209 part 2)

0.6 (2013-03-20)
----------------
 - Emit MethodCalled() signal on the DBusMock interface, as an alternative way
   of verifying method calls. Thanks Lars Uebernickel.
 - DBusMockObject.AddTemplate() and DBusTestCase.spawn_server_template() can
   now load local templates by specifying a path to a *.py file as template
   name. Thanks Lucas De Marchi.
 - Quit mock process if the D-BUS it connected to goes down. (LP: #1156561)
 - Support Get() and GetAll() with empty interface names, default to main
   interface in this case.
 - Add template for systemd's logind.

0.5 (2013-02-03)
----------------
 - upower template: Change LidIsClosed property default value to False.
 - Add polkitd template. (LP: #1112551)

0.4.0 (2013-01-21)
------------------
 - Add GetCalls(), GetMethodCalls() and ClearCalls() methods on the mock D-BUS
   interface to query the call log, for cases where parsing stdout is
   inconvenient. Thanks to Robert Bruce Park for the patch! (LP: #1099483)
 - Document how to keep internal state in AddMethod().
 - Add template for gnome-screensaver. Thanks to Bastien Nocera!
 - Fix logging of signal arguments to have the same format as method call
   arguments.

0.3.1 (2013-01-07)
------------------
 - upower template: Set Energy and EnergyFull properties.

0.3 (2012-12-19)
----------------
 - In the logging of mock method calls, log the arguments as well.
 - Fix race condition in waiting for mock to get online on the bus, by avoiding
   triggering D-BUS service activation with system-installed services.
 - Add "notification_daemon" mock template.

0.2.2 (2012-11-27)
------------------
 - tests: Suppress "nmcli and NetworkManager versions don't match" warning.
 - networkmanager template: Add DeviceState enum for easier specification of
   states. Thanks Alberto Ruiz.
 - Fix deprecation warnings with PyGObject 3.7.x.

0.2.1 (2012-11-15)
------------------
 - Fix tests to skip instead of fail if NetworkManager or upower are not
   installed.

0.2.0 (2012-11-15)
------------------
 - Turn dbusmock from a module into a package. This is transparent for API
   users, but necessary for adding future subpackages and also makes the code
   more maintainable.
 - Run pyflakes and pep8 during test suite, if available.
 - Add support for templates: You can now call AddTemplate() on the
   org.freedesktop.DBus.Mock interface to load a template into the mock, or in
   Python, start a server process with loading a template with
   DBusTestCase.spawn_server_template(). Templates set up the common structure
   of these services (their main objects, properties, and methods) so that you
   do not need to carry around this common code, and only need to set up the
   particular properties and specific D-BUS objects that you need. These
   templates can be parameterized for common customizations, and they can
   provide additional convenience methods on the org.freedesktop.DBus.Mock
   interface to provide more abstract functionality like "add a battery".
 - Add a first simple "upower" template with convenience methods to add AC and
   battery objects, and change tests/test_upower.py to use it.
 - Add a first "networkmanager" template with convenience methods to add
   Ethernet/WiFi devices and access points. Thanks Iftikhar Ahmad!
 - Add symbol dbusmock.MOCK_IFACE for 'org.freedesktop.DBus.Mock'.
 - Add test cases for command line invocation (python3 -m dbusmock ...).

0.1.3 (2012-11-03)
------------------
 - Ship NEWS in release tarballs.

0.1.2 (2012-10-10)

   according to the signature.
 - dbusmock.py, method calls: Convert arguments to the right data types
   according to the signature.
 - tests/test_api.py: Check proper handling of signature vs. argument list
   length and/or type mismatch. (LP: #1064836)

 - setup.py: Get version from NEWS file.

0.1.1 (2012-10-04)

   is not callable" error when running "setup.py test" with python 2.7.

 - dbusmock.py: Also put first (main) object into the global objects map.
 - dbusmock.py: Document global objects map in AddMethod().

 - dbusmock.py: Fix stopping of local D-Bus daemons for test subclasses.
 - dbusmock.py, stop_dbus(): Wait for local D-Bus to be killed, and avoid
   getting SIGTERMed ourselves.

   properties to one interface at once. Update upower test case to use this.
 - dbusmock.py: Add EmitSignal() method to emit an arbitrary signal on any
   interface.
 - Make code compatible with Python 2.7 as well. (LP: #1060278)

0.0.3 (2012-10-01)
------------------
 - tests/test_api.py: Add tests for GetAll()
 - wait_for_bus_object(): Poll for Introspect() instead of GetAll(), as some
   services such as gnome-session don't implement GetAll() properly.
 - Rename "dbus_mock" module to "dbusmock", to be more consistent with the
   project name and Python module name conventions.
