   wrong object.

   Pete Woods.

0.16 (2015-10-08)
-----------------

0.15.2 (2015-06-11)
-------------------
 - test_ofono: Test fields which don't get obfuscated with Ubuntu's latest
   ofono (See LP #1459983). Thanks Iain Lane.
 - timedated template: Add NTPSynchronized property and set it in SetNTP(), to
   also work with systemd 220.

0.15.1 (2015-05-12)
-------------------
 - SECURITY FIX: When loading a template from an arbitrary file through the
   AddTemplate() D-Bus method call or DBusTestCase.spawn_server_template()
   Python method, don't create or use Python's *.pyc cached files. By tricking
   a user into loading a template from a world-writable directory like /tmp, an
   attacker could run arbitrary code with the user's privileges by putting a
   crafted .pyc file into that directory. Note that this is highly unlikely to
   actually appear in practice as custom dbusmock templates are usually shipped
   in project directories, not directly in world-writable directories.
   Thanks to Simon McVittie for discovering this!
   (LP: #1453815, CVE-2015-1326)

   Thanks Philip Whitnall!
 - Add Reset() mock interface method to reset that object’s state (including
   removing all its sub-objects) as if the object or template had been
   destroyed and re-created. This is intended for use at the end of test cases
   to reset state before the next test case is run, as an alternative to

   avoid accidentally reacting to other signals (like from BlueZ). Thanks

 - Accept *.py files for the --template command line option, similar to
   AddTemplate(). Thanks Emanuele Aina.
 - Pass log file to objects created with AddObject(). Thanks Emanuele Aina.

   Thanks Pete Woods.

0.6.3 (2013-06-13)
------------------
 - Drop "can-suspend" and "can-hibernate" checks from upower template test.

   input ID of 0. (LP: #1190209 part 1)

   of verifying method calls. Thanks Lars Uebernickel.
 - DBusMockObject.AddTemplate() and DBusTestCase.spawn_server_template() can

   name. Thanks Lucas De Marchi.

 - Fix tests to skip instead of fail if NetworkManager or upower are not
   installed.

0.2.0 (2012-11-15)
------------------
 - Turn dbusmock from a module into a package. This is transparent for API
   users, but necessary for adding future subpackages and also makes the code
   more maintainable.
 - Run pyflakes and pep8 during test suite, if available.
 - Add support for templates: You can now call AddTemplate() on the
   org.freedesktop.DBus.Mock interface to load a template into the mock, or in
   Python, start a server process with loading a template with
   DBusTestCase.spawn_server_template(). Templates set up the common structure
   of these services (their main objects, properties, and methods) so that you
   do not need to carry around this common code, and only need to set up the
   particular properties and specific D-BUS objects that you need. These
   templates can be parameterized for common customizations, and they can
   provide additional convenience methods on the org.freedesktop.DBus.Mock
   interface to provide more abstract functionality like "add a battery".
 - Add a first simple "upower" template with convenience methods to add AC and
   battery objects, and change tests/test_upower.py to use it.
 - Add a first "networkmanager" template with convenience methods to add
   Ethernet/WiFi devices and access points. Thanks Iftikhar Ahmad!
 - Add symbol dbusmock.MOCK_IFACE for 'org.freedesktop.DBus.Mock'.
 - Add test cases for command line invocation (python3 -m dbusmock ...).

0.0.3 (2012-10-01)
------------------
 - tests/test_api.py: Add tests for GetAll()
 - wait_for_bus_object(): Poll for Introspect() instead of GetAll(), as some

   project name and Python module name conventions.
