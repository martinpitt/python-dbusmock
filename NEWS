0.4.0 (2013-01-21)
------------------
 - Add GetCalls(), GetMethodCalls() and ClearCalls() methods on the mock D-BUS
   interface to query the call log, for cases where parsing stdout is
   inconvenient. Thanks to Robert Bruce Park for the patch! (LP: #1099483)
 - Document how to keep internal state in AddMethod().
 - Add template for gnome-screensaver. Thanks to Bastien Nocera!
 - Fix logging of signal arguments to have the same format as method call
   arguments.

0.3.1 (2013-01-07)
------------------
 - upower template: Set Energy and EnergyFull properties.

0.3 (2012-12-19)
----------------
 - In the logging of mock method calls, log the arguments as well.
 - Fix race condition in waiting for mock to get online on the bus, by avoiding
   triggering D-BUS service activation with system-installed services.
 - Add "notification_daemon" mock template.

0.2.2 (2012-11-27)
------------------
 - tests: Suppress "nmcli and NetworkManager versions don't match" warning.
 - networkmanager template: Add DeviceState enum for easier specification of
   states. Thanks Alberto Ruiz.
 - Fix deprecation warnings with PyGObject 3.7.x.

0.2.1 (2012-11-15)
------------------
 - Fix tests to skip instead of fail if NetworkManager or upower are not
   installed.

0.2.0 (2012-11-15)
------------------
 - Turn dbusmock from a module into a package. This is transparent for API
   users, but necessary for adding future subpackages and also makes the code
   more maintainable.
 - Run pyflakes and pep8 during test suite, if available.
 - Add support for templates: You can now call AddTemplate() on the
   org.freedesktop.DBus.Mock interface to load a template into the mock, or in
   Python, start a server process with loading a template with
   DBusTestCase.spawn_server_template(). Templates set up the common structure
   of these services (their main objects, properties, and methods) so that you
   do not need to carry around this common code, and only need to set up the
   particular properties and specific D-BUS objects that you need. These
   templates can be parameterized for common customizations, and they can
   provide additional convenience methods on the org.freedesktop.DBus.Mock
   interface to provide more abstract functionality like "add a battery".
 - Add a first simple "upower" template with convenience methods to add AC and
   battery objects, and change tests/test_upower.py to use it.
 - Add a first "networkmanager" template with convenience methods to add
   Ethernet/WiFi devices and access points. Thanks Iftikhar Ahmad!
 - Add symbol dbusmock.MOCK_IFACE for 'org.freedesktop.DBus.Mock'.
 - Add test cases for command line invocation (python3 -m dbusmock ...).

0.1.3 (2012-11-03)
------------------
 - Ship NEWS in release tarballs.

0.1.2 (2012-10-10)
------------------
 - dbusmock.py, EmitSignal(): Convert arguments to the right data types
   according to the signature.
 - dbusmock.py, method calls: Convert arguments to the right data types
   according to the signature.
 - tests/test_api.py: Check proper handling of signature vs. argument list
   length and/or type mismatch. (LP: #1064836)
 - tests/test_upower.py: Add test for handling "DeviceChanged" signal.
 - setup.py: Get version from NEWS file.

0.1.1 (2012-10-04)
------------------
 - setup.py: Use README.rst as long description.
 - setup.py: Add download URL.
 - tests/test_consolekit.py: Skip test if ck-list-sessions is not installed.
 - setup.py: Import "multiprocessing" to work around "'NoneType' object
   is not callable" error when running "setup.py test" with python 2.7.

0.1 (2012-10-04)
----------------
 - tests/test_api.py: Add tests for adding existing objects.
 - dbusmock.py: Also put first (main) object into the global objects map.
 - dbusmock.py: Document global objects map in AddMethod().
 - tests/test_upower.py: Silence "No ... property" warnings; the test does not
   create them all.
 - dbusmock.py: Fix stopping of local D-Bus daemons for test subclasses.
 - dbusmock.py, stop_dbus(): Wait for local D-Bus to be killed, and avoid
   getting SIGTERMed ourselves.
 - dbusmock.py: Add AddProperties() method to conveniently add several
   properties to one interface at once. Update upower test case to use this.
 - dbusmock.py: Add EmitSignal() method to emit an arbitrary signal on any
   interface.
 - Make code compatible with Python 2.7 as well. (LP: #1060278)

0.0.3 (2012-10-01)
------------------
 - tests/test_api.py: Add tests for GetAll()
 - wait_for_bus_object(): Poll for Introspect() instead of GetAll(), as some
   services such as gnome-session don't implement GetAll() properly.
 - Rename "dbus_mock" module to "dbusmock", to be more consistent with the
   project name and Python module name conventions.
 - Support adding properties to different interfaces.
 - Support adding methods to different interfaces.

0.0.2 (2012-10-01)
------------------
 - setup.py: Add categories.
